 - user: What actions did Oliverotto take to execute his plans in Fermo, and how did the duke ensure Oliverotto's capture in Sinigalia?
```
Respond with: Oliverotto executed his plans in Fermo by arranging a solemn banquet at Giovanni Fogliani's house, where he invited Giovanni and the chiefs of Fermo. During the banquet, after the usual entertainments, Oliverotto began discussing grave matters, including the greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, as part of his wicked designs. In Sinigalia, the duke ensured Oliverotto's capture by signaling to Don Michele to prevent Oliverotto from escaping. Don Michele advised Oliverotto to send his men to their quarters and meet the duke. Oliverotto followed this advice, joined the duke, and entered Sinigalia with the party. Once inside the duke's quarters, Oliverotto was taken to a secret chamber where the duke made him a prisoner.
